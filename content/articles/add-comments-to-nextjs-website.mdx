## Introduction

Adding comments to a [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) website is a challenge. The main reason for this is because
comments require some sort of database, and (one of) Jamstack's selling point is that it doesn't need one!
You can choose to connect a database such as [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) or [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/) - but we're not going to do that because it's

- challenging
- time consuming
- **costs money!**

In this article, I'll show you how to connect [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) to your React based application.

## What Is Utterances?

Utteranc under the hood interacts with the [GitHub api](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to store all of your comments in the issues tab. According to their website, some of the pros of using utteranc are:

- Open source. üôå
- No tracking, no ads, always free. üì°üö´
- No lock-in. All data stored in GitHub issues. üîì
- Styled with Primer, the css toolkit that powers GitHub. üíÖ
- Dark theme. üåò
- Lightweight. Vanilla TypeScript. No font downloads, JavaScript frameworks or polyfills for evergreen browsers. üê¶üå≤

I don't know about you, but this sounds like a great comment solution.

## Adding Utterances To A React Website

If you want to add Utteranc to a simple html site, all you need to do is paste in a `<script>` tag. Unfortuantly, in React, we can't do this. We need to create a [custom component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html).

### Step 1: Create a GitHub repo

The first step is to create a GitHub repo to store your comments. You can use the same repo that your website
is pushed to, however, I recommend creating a new one just for the comments. You can then name this `comments-your-website-name` - or another name if you feel so inclined.

> ‚ùó Make sure this repo is public and that Utterances is authorized. ‚ùó

### Step 2: Create The React Component

Next, create a component named `Comments.js` in your app.

Add the following code:

```JavaScript:Comments.js
import React, { Component } from "react";

export default class Comments extends Component {

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.commentBox = React.createRef(); // use ref to create our element
    }

    componentDidMount() {
        scriptEl.setAttribute("theme", 'github-light');
        let scriptEl = document.createElement("script");
        scriptEl.setAttribute("src", "https://utteranc.es/client.js");
        scriptEl.setAttribute("crossorigin", "anonymous");
        scriptEl.setAttribute("async", true);
        scriptEl.setAttribute("repo", "your-repo-name-here"); // i.e. bjcarlson42/comments-coffeeclass.io
        scriptEl.setAttribute("issue-term", "url"); // you can change 'url' with other options
        this.commentBox.current.appendChild(scriptEl);
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div style={{ width: '100%' }} id="comments">
                <div ref={this.commentBox} />
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

As you can see, we are doing the following:

- Create a class named Comments which extends Component
- Creating our element using `React.createRef()`
- Using `componentDidMount()` to set all the properties

Be sure to include your repo name on this line:

```JavaScript
scriptEl.setAttribute("repo", "your-repo-name-here");
```

Be sure to add your username too. For example, I would do `bjcarlson42/comments-coffeeclass.io` and not `comments-coffeeclass.io`.

#### Dynamic colorMode

If you want to dynamically change the color mode, you can do that too. Here is an example
of that using [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

```JavaScript:Comments.js
import React, { Component } from "react";

export default class Comments extends Component {

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.commentBox = React.createRef(); // use ref to create our element
    }

    componentDidMount() {
        // dynamically getting color mode
        let colorMode = localStorage.getItem('chakra-ui-color-mode');
        const utteranceTheme = colorMode === "dark" ? "github-dark" : "github-light";
        scriptEl.setAttribute("theme", utteranceTheme);

        // or
        scriptEl.setAttribute("theme", 'github-light');

        // rest
        let scriptEl = document.createElement("script");
        scriptEl.setAttribute("src", "https://utteranc.es/client.js");
        scriptEl.setAttribute("crossorigin", "anonymous");
        scriptEl.setAttribute("async", true);
        scriptEl.setAttribute("repo", "your-repo-name-here"); // i.e. bjcarlson42/comments-coffeeclass.io
        scriptEl.setAttribute("issue-term", "url"); // you can change 'url' with other options
        this.commentBox.current.appendChild(scriptEl);
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div style={{ width: '100%' }} id="comments">
                <div ref={this.commentBox} />
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

Finally, we return the actual html:

```JavaScript:Comments.js
render() {
        return (
            <div style={{ width: '100%' }} id="comments">
                <div ref={this.commentBox} />
            </div>
        );
    }
```

> Make sure to add the `style={{ width: '100%' }}` otherwise your comment box will be squished. The `id=comments` is optional.

Now, go ahead and test it out by importing the component anywhere in your application! If you have questions feel free to leave them in the comments below - which uses utteranc ;).

Update Dec. 16, 2021: We no longer use utterancs! We have migrated to [Giscus](https://giscus.app).
