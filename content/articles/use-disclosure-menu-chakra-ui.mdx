## Introduction

[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) is a component based React library that allows us to rapidly build beautiful, responsive, and accessible user interfaces. One of the components it gives us, is the `Menu` component. Out of the box, to expand the menu, you need to click on the `MenuButton`. In this snippet, I'll show you how to use the `useDisclosure` hook to create a dropdown menu on hover.

## useDisclosure

### Definition

[useDisclosure](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/hooks/use-disclosure) is defined in the Chakra UI documentation as such:

> `useDisclosure` is a custom hook used to help handle common open, close, or toggle scenarios. It can be used to control feedback component such as `Modal`, `AlertDialog`, `Drawer`, etc.

### Import

We can import the `useDisclosure` hook from `@chakra-ui/react`.

```javascript
import { useDisclosure } from '@chakra-ui/react'
```

### Usage

Here is how you would use the `useDisclosure` hook to create a dropdown menu on hover. In the next section, we'll take a look at each line and explain what is happening.

```javascript:Navbar.js
import {
    useDisclosure,
    MenuItem,
    Menu,
    MenuButton,
    MenuList,
} from "@chakra-ui/react"
import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from '@chakra-ui/icons'

export default function Navbar() {
    const { isOpen, onOpen, onClose } = useDisclosure()
    return (
        <Menu isOpen={isOpen}>
            <MenuButton
                variant="ghost"
                mx={1}
                py={[1, 2, 2]}
                px={4}
                borderRadius={5}
                _hover={{ bg: useColorModeValue("gray.100", "gray.700") }}
                aria-label="Courses"
                fontWeight="normal"
                onMouseEnter={onOpen}
                onMouseLeave={onClose}
            >
                More {isOpen ? <ChevronUpIcon /> : <ChevronDownIcon />}
            </MenuButton>
            <MenuList onMouseEnter={onOpen} onMouseLeave={onClose}>
                <MenuItem>Menu Item 1</MenuItem>
                <MenuItem>Menu Item 2</MenuItem>
                <MenuItem>Menu Item 3</MenuItem>
            </MenuList>
        </Menu>
    )
}
```

## Explanation

Let's take a more detailed look at the code. First, we are importing the `useDisclosure` hook and the `Menu` components. We are also importing 2 Chakra UI icons to make the dropdown look a bit nicer.

We are using the `useDisclosure` hook like such:

```javascript
const { isOpen, onOpen, onClose } = useDisclosure()
```

We can then use `isOpen`, `onOpen`, and `onClose` to control the state of the dropdown.

- `isOpen` is a boolean that tells us if the dropdown is open or not.
- `onOpen` is a callback function to set a truthy value for the isOpen parameter.
- `onClose` is a callback function to set a falsy value for the isOpen parameter.

### `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave`

At this point, the Menu dropdown works, but there is still no hover effect! To add this we can use `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` to control the state of the dropdown.

When we use it like such:

```javascript
onMouseEnter = { onOpen }
onMouseLeave = { onClose }
```

We are saying when a user hovers over that Component, set the `isOpen` parameter to `true`. When they leave the Component, set the `isOpen` parameter to `false`. Simple!

> The [mouseenter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseenter_event) event is fired at an Element when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is initially moved so that its hotspot is within the element at which the event was fired.

> The [mouseleave](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseleave_event) event is fired at an Element when the cursor of a pointing device (usually a mouse) is moved out of it.

## Conclusion

In this snippet you learned how to use the `useDisclosure` hook paired with `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` to create a dropdown menu on hover.
