## Introduction

Most websites use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) to track users and events. This is a great way to get an idea of how your website is performing. However, there are some downsides to using Google Analytics.

1. They sell your data
2. It slows down your website speed slightly
3. There is a significant learning curve

In this snippet, we will explore an alternative analytics solution called [Splitbee Analytics](https://www.splitbee.com/).

<Step number="1" title="Register" />

Navigate to [https://splitbee.io/](https://splitbee.io/) and sign up for a free account (no credit card required).

<Step number="2" title="Add The Tracking Tag" />

Add the folling tag to the head of your website. In Next.js this is inside of `_document.js`.

```javascript
<script async src="https://cdn.splitbee.io/sb.js"></script>
```

```javascript:_document.js
import NextDocument, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'

export default class MyDocument extends NextDocument {
    render() {
        return (
            <Html lang="en">
                <Head>
                    {/* Splitbee Analytics */}
                    <script async src="https://cdn.splitbee.io/sb.js"></script>
                </Head>
                <body>
                    <Main />
                    <NextScript />
                </body>
            </Html>
        )
    }
}
```

<Step number="3" title="Go To Your Site" />

Navigate to your site and you should see analytics flow through your dashboard!

<Step number="4" title="Advanced Usage" />
