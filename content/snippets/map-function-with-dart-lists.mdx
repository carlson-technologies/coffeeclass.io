## The Problem

Recently, I was building a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwsqmEBhDiARIsANV8H3aB8Bs-JYv8Pupzys4lwa3Trgh2gIfCWxUGsf4BuCIVxM0VJnT6sikaAmc_EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) app and
I needed to map over an array of users when a user logged in and check if their username, password, and security question answer matched what was
in the database (the userArray). I tried to do something like this:

```dart
var userArray = ['User 1', 'User 2', 'User 3'];

userArray
    .map((user) => {
            if (user == 'User 1')
            {
                // log user in
            } else {
                    // don't log user in
                }
            });
```

> Quick note: I removed some of my project specific logic and only included the important parts so it is easier to follow.

This code logs the user in *if* they are user 1. This looks like it should work, right? Unfortunately, it doesn't. It will not break either. Instead,
nothing will happen. This makes it hard to debug.

## The Solution

The simple solution is to add `.toList()` to the end of the map statement.

```dart
var userArray = ['User 1', 'User 2', 'User 3'];

userArray
    .map((user) => {
            if (user == 'User 1')
            {
                // log user in
            } else {
                    // don't log user in
                }
            }).toList(); // add .toList() here!
```

## Why This Works

Unlike in [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), in Dart when you `.map()` over an object, the `Iterable` that
is returned is `lazy`. This means it is not evaluated by calling `.map()`. To `evaluate` it, we need to call `.toList()`. You
can read more about this [here](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.12.4/dart-core/Iterable-class.html).

If you want to quickly see this in action, open up [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/?null_safety=true) and paste in the code below (with added print statements)
with and without `.toList()`.

```dart
void main() {
  var userArray = ['User 1', 'User 2', 'User 3'];

userArray
    .map((user) => {
            if (user == 'User 1')
            {
                print('logging user 1 in!')
            } else {
                    print('Not user 1, can\'t log in!')
                }
            }).toList(); // Remove .toList() to see no output!
}
```

## From The Flutter Docs

<br />

### .map()

> `Iterable<T>` `map<T>`(T Function(String) f)

Returns a new lazy Iterable with elements that are created by calling f on each element of this Iterable in iteration order.

This method returns a view of the mapped elements. As long as the returned Iterable is not iterated over, the supplied function f will not be invoked. The transformed elements will not be cached. Iterating multiple times over the returned Iterable will invoke the supplied function f multiple times on the same element.

Methods on the returned iterable are allowed to omit calling f on any element where the result isn't needed. For example, elementAt may call f only once.

### .toList()

> `List<Set<Set<void>>>` toList({bool growable = true})

Creates a List containing the elements of this Iterable.

The elements are in iteration order. The list is fixed-length if growable is false.
