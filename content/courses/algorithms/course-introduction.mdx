## Introduction

Algorithms are a fundamental part of computer science. They are used to solve problems, and they are the foundation of everything we do. In this course you will learn how to implement and analyze algorithms using Big O.

## Level

This course is at the intermediate level. You should be familiar with at least one language, preferably an object oriented language. Some of the examples will cover a variety of languages while others will only use one. Each example at the very least will include Java exmaples.

## Date Published
