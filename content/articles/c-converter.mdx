## Introduction

C can be a very difficut language to learn. From compiling it, to accepting user input, every aspect has a significant learning curve. In this article, we will build a C converter program which takes in a number between 0 and 100 and returns a letter grade.

## Creating Our File

Create a file named `converter.c`.

## Imports

To import external libraries, we use the `#include` directive. In this program, we will use the `stdio.h` library. This library contains many basic functions, such as `printf`, `scanf`, and `getchar`.

```c:converter.c
#include <stdio.h>
```

## Main

We will declare our main program with a return type of int. The function will not take in any args so we will use `void`.

```c:converter.c
int main(void)
{
    // code will go here!

    return 0;
}
```

Note the line `return 0;` at the end of the function. This means the function has finished running successfully. If we changed this to `return 1;`, that would mean the function would have failed.

## Accepting User Input

Now that we have our function, we can begin by getting an `int` from the user. We will achieve this in two steps.

1. Declare a variable to hold the user's input.
2. Use the `scanf` function to get the user's input.

```c:converter.c
int main(void)
{
    int grade; // local variable of type int to store numerical grade

    printf("Enter a numeric grade: "); // prompt user for input
    scanf("%d", &grade); // store input in local variable grade

    return 0;
}
```

We use `%d` to tell the `scanf` function to read in an `int` and store it in the variable `grade`. We use `&grade` to tell the function to store the value of `grade` in the memory address of `grade`.

## If/Else Statements

Lastly, we will use an `if/else` statement to determine the letter grade.

```c:converter.c
if (grade > 100 || grade < 0) printf("Invalid grade.\n");
    else if (grade >= 90) printf("A\n");
    else if (grade >= 80) printf("B\n");
    else if (grade >= 70) printf("C\n");
    else if (grade >= 60) printf("D\n");
    else printf("F\n"); // end if else statement
```

> `\n` is an escape code that tells the compiler to print a new line!

## Complete Program

All together the code looks like this:

```c:converter.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int grade; // local variable of type int to store numerical grade

    printf("Enter a numeric grade: "); // prompt user for input
    scanf("%d", &grade); // store input in local variable grade

    // start if else statement to determine letter grade
    if (grade > 100 || grade < 0) printf("Invalid grade.\n");
    else if (grade >= 90) printf("A\n");
    else if (grade >= 80) printf("B\n");
    else if (grade >= 70) printf("C\n");
    else if (grade >= 60) printf("D\n");
    else printf("F\n"); // end if else statement

    return 0;
}
```

## Compiling

To compile our program, we will use the `gcc` command.

```bash
gcc -o converter converter.c
```

This will compile our program and allow us to run it by typing `./converter`. We are using the `-o` flag to tell the compiler to output the executable to the file `converter` instead of the default `a.out`.

## Running

To run our program, we will use the `./converter` command.

```bash
./converter
```

If you run the program and pass in a grade of 87, you should see the following output:

```bash
Enter a numeric grade: 87
B
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we created a C program which takes in a numerical grade and returns the letter grade. We covered some basic C concepts such as variables, if/else statements, and functions. We also used the `gcc` command to compile our program. Happy coding!
