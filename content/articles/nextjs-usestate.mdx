## Hooks Overview

React Hooks were introducted React 16.8. They allow you to create stateful components without writing a class. For more info, check out [an article](using-react-useeffect) we wrote on the `useEffect` hook.

## What is `useState` Hook?

The `useState` hook lets you manage state throughout your application. Let's take a look at an example.

### What does calling useState do?

Simply put, a state variable persists the state throughout the lifecycle of your application instead of dissapearing when the function is exited.

> From the React Docs: It declares a “state variable”. Our variable is called count but we could call it anything else, like banana. This is a way to “preserve” some values between the function calls — useState is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that this.state provides in a class. Normally, variables “disappear” when the function exits but state variables are preserved by React.

### `useState` Hook Example

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react'

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The example above is from the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html). As you can see, we are storing the count inside a state variable.

We can access the count from the `count` variable and we can change the count using the `setCount` function.

> You cannot change a useState variable directly (i.e. `count = 7`) because it is read only. You must use the `setCount` function to change the value.

### More Complex Example

You can also store more than a simple number in a state variable. Let's look at some examples.

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
const [name, setName] = useState('Max');
const [items, setItems] = useState([1, 2, 3]);
const [bool, setBool] = useState(true);
const [obj, setObj] = useState({ a: 1, b: 2 });
const [null, setNull] = useState(null);
```

As you can see, we can store ints, strings, arrays, booleans, objects, nulls, custom objects, and more inside of a `useState` variable.

## Uses of `useState`

A cool use of `useState` is to dynamically change a `css` value. Maybe as the user scrolls, we want to change the `font-size` of the text.

```javascript
const [fontSize, setFontSize] = useState('10px')
const handleScroll = () => {
    setFontSize(window.scrollY + "px")
}

...

<p style={{ fontSize: fontSize }}>
    Hello World
</p>
```

The `p` tag above will increase in size as the user scrolls down the page!
